# towing

I’ve made this script for a server which I used to develop for around a year ago, unfortunately though, the server has died before even having a go at using the script, originally it was meant to work with the ESX framework only, but I’ve decided to convert it to be a standalone script, the reason why I made this script in the first place was because I’ve seen a similar one which was/is paid 7, so I preferred to give it a go myself as I was pretty sure I could recreate it myself.

Anyway, enough backstory for the origin of this script.

Here’s a quick and nasty showcase of the script: https://youtu.be/y_QYMiO0vJ8

Quick disclaimer, at the moment the script doesn’t find the big trailers, like the army trailer you can see in the showcase, if anyone feels like trying to sort that out, or suggest a fix, feel free to leave a message on this thread or do a pull request on github

Also, don’t use this code to make yet another paid version of this :)
